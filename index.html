            <h3>Variegated</h3>
            <p>Do you ever go back and forth when choosing an aesthetic? Whether its minimalist, bold and colorful, or straight earthy tones, the indecisiveness of having to choose between every other color of the rainbow is daunting. All while you've just gotten the random urge to remodel every room in the house, but that just might be my ADHD. Nontheless, any variegated plant can definitely brighten up a space no matter your style. You have endless options to choose from since the leaves can come in all sorts of patterns and shades. </p>

            <h3>Succulents</h3>
            <p>Succulents are very low maintanence, a great choice for beginners wanting to start on their green thumb journey. This variety of plant can thrive in any enviornment, and because they store water in their stems and leaves, there is no need to worry if you have fleeting thoughts. They can go without a proper watering cycle unlike most plants, 3-4 weeks or unless the soil is dry throughout is what you should look out for.</p>
